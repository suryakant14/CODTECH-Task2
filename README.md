# Overview of the Project    
## Title of Project: Vulnerability Scanning Tool    
## Problem Statement 
Create a simple vulnerability scanning tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports, outdated software versions, and misconfigurations.

# Objective
The objective of this vulnerability scanning tool is to identify and remediate security weaknesses in web applications. It detects open ports, outdated software, and misconfigurations, providing actionable recommendations for remediation. The tool helps developers, security professionals, and organizations improve security, meet compliance requirements, and reduce costs. 

# Features 
1. Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection: Detects open ports, outdated software, and misconfigurations, providing a comprehensive view of web application security.
2. Actionable Remediation Recommendations: Provides step-by-step recommendations for remediation, enabling developers and security professionals to quickly address identified vulnerabilities.
3. Improved Security Posture: Helps organizations improve their security posture by identifying and remediating vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of attacks and data breaches.

# Technical Details 
1. Vulnerability Scanning: The code performs a vulnerability scan on a target (IP address or domain) by checking for open ports, outdated software, and potential misconfigurations.
2. GUI Interface: The code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter to interact with the user. The GUI has a text entry field for the target, a button to start the scan, and a scrolled text widget to display the results.
3. Socket Programming: The code uses the socket module to create a socket object and connect to the target to scan for open ports.
4. HTTP Requests: The code uses the requests module (not imported in the code snippet) to send HTTP requests to the target to fetch the HTTP headers and check for outdated software and misconfigurations.
5. Multithreading: The code does not use multithreading, which means that the GUI may become unresponsive during the scan. To improve the GUI's responsiveness, the scan functionality could be run in a separate thread.

# How to Use
1. Save the code in a file with a .py extension, for example, vulnerability_scanner.py.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:
3. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:
4. Enter the target IP address or domain name in the text entry field, for example, example.com or 192.168.1.1.
5. Click the "Start Scan" button to initiate the vulnerability scan. The results will be displayed in the scrolled text widget.

This tool is for educational purposes only and should not be used to scan systems without permission.
